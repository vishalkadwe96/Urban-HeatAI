# Urban Heat AI v2 — Risk Explainer Service
#
# Addresses two gaps in the original HVI-only model:
#   1. "High temperature != automatically highest risk" — a single HVI number
#      hides WHY a zone is risky. This decomposes it into Hazard / Exposure /
#      Vulnerability (the standard disaster-risk framework: Risk = f(H, E, V))
#      so a judge/planner can see which factor is actually driving the score,
#      instead of temperature alone standing in for "risk".
#   2. The existing recommendation set (recommendation_service.py) is written
#      for planners/municipal authorities (cool roofs, tree cover — long-term
#      infrastructure). This adds a SEPARATE, citizen-facing set: what an
#      ordinary person in that zone should actually do right now.
#
# Deliberately stays free of any external API — everything here is derived
# from fields _generate_grid() already computes (heat_service.py), so it has
# zero added latency or failure surface.
