    Anchors the synthetic grid's baseline LST to the most real reading available,

      3. Static per-city baseline (offline fallback)
    Falls through silently on any failure so the app keeps working offline.

    Satellite path: POWER's Earth Skin Temperature is already a ground-temperature
    reading (not air temp), so it only gets a small urban-core bump — it's much
    closer to true LST than the Open-Meteo anchor is.

    Open-Meteo path: uses TODAY'S FORECASTED DAYTIME MAX temperature (not the
    current live temp) as the anchor, since LST is a satellite reading captured
    during daytime peak heat — anchoring to right-now temperature would make the
    grid go unrealistically cool at night/early morning. Falls back to current
    temp if daily max is unavailable. India-specific note: dense urban cores
    commonly run 5-10°C hotter than ambient air temperature (LST vs air temp
    gap), scaled here by each city's heat-factor (hf) since that already
    reflects how "urban-heavy" the city is.
