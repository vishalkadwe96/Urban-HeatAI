# Urban Heat AI v2 — Recommendation Service
#
# Simulation is now model-driven: each scenario nudges the physical drivers that
# actually cause cooling (vegetation cover / built-up heat retention) per zone,
# feeds the adjusted zone through the trained RandomForest LST model
# (backend/ml/train_lst_model.py), and re-derives risk/health impact from the
# model's *predicted* LST — instead of a single hardcoded "°C per %" multiplier
# applied uniformly city-wide. Falls back to the old linear formula if the model
# hasn't been trained yet, so the endpoint never breaks.
#
# get_zone_recommendations() now returns THREE things per zone, not one:
#   - actions:            planner/municipal-facing infrastructure interventions,
#                          now hazard-aware (heat / landslide / rain), not just heat
#   - breakdown:           Hazard/Exposure/Vulnerability decomposition of WHY this
#                          zone is risky, instead of one opaque HVI number
#                          (risk_explainer_service.py)
#   - public_safety_tips:  citizen-facing "what to do right now", separate from
#                          the planner actions above (risk_explainer_service.py)
